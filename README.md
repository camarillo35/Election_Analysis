# Election_Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to help Colorado Board of Elections employee Tom in completing an audit of the tabulated results of Colorado's U.S. Congressional precinct. We plan to create a report which shows the total number of votes cast, the total number of votes for each candidate, the percentage of votes cast for each candidate, and the winner of the election. As well as a specific analysis of each county voter turnout. Tom's manager had asked us to develop a code in Python so that the code could be modified with minimal work and applied to other elections audits.
